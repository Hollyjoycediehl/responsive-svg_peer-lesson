<b>This is an instructional repository on how to create a responsive svg using Adobe Illustrator and CSS</b>


1. Open sample or personal logo file in Adobe Illustrator
   * If you are using a personal logo, make sure to duplicate your file. One copy will be used to determine the tablet and mobile states of the logo; The other will be saved out as a svg.
   
1. In the first document, replicate the logo twice and determine simplified versions for tablet and mobile
    * You will not use these replications, but they will help you envision the different logo states needed.

1. Group elements based on what you want to hide for the responsive versions determined in step 2.
